# Problem 6: Max And Min In A Unsorted Array

## Description
Traverse the input array once and keep track of min and max values.  Sorting (and then extracting the first and
last elements to find the min and max) is not necessary here and is computationally less efficient (O(n log n) instead
of O(n) as discussed below).

## Complexity: Time
O(n) to traverse the input array once. 

## Complexity: Space
O(1) to hold the min and max values.
